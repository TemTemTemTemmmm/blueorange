A PhpMyAdmin Theme with lots of border radii and box shadows

## Summary

The theme was built while diving into sass, using firefox 12, and as far as I am aware is compatible with firefox 11+, opera 11+, chrome 12+, I don't have a windows machine at the moment so I could not test it on IE

### Requirements
* phpMyAdmin 3.52 or later

### Usage
* Extract the contents into the theme directory
* Rename the directory to blueorange
* Select it in the pma mainpage
